# Data Structures and Algorithms

This is me following the book 'Mastering Algorithms with C' by Kyle Loudon.

## Update

Move on to another book, 'Algorithm Design Manual'. This one is better because
it explains some things that should gbe explained.

## Goals

- learn data structures and algorithms for real this time 
- learn how to debug C code
- learn how to read code
- learn to write useful documentation
- implement useful data structures and algorithms
- after this I will work on my problem-solving skills

## Progress

### Data Structures

I wish to write my own custom implementation for all the data structures listed here. I don't know 
if it will be a separate library or included here.

- Linked Lists
  - Single Linked
  - Double Linked
  - Circular Linked
- Stacks and Queues
  - Stack as Linked List
  - Queue as a linked list
- Sets
  - book
- Hash tables
  - book
- Trees
  - normal
  - binary search
- Heaps
  - Priority Queue
