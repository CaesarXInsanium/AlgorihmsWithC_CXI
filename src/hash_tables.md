# Hash Tables

Hash tables are all based on the simple act of hashing data. Regardless of storage 
implementation, look-ups in hash table are incredibly fast and efficient. Any piece of data 
is accessed via a *key*, which yields a *value*.

Due to nature of the hashing function, lookup times are constant. Good hashing function almost 
never generate identical keys. Collision happens when two values get hashed to the same key.
This happens because sometimes it simply is not realistic to have a unique key for all values.
However, a proper implementation of a hash table has a way to deal with this fact.
