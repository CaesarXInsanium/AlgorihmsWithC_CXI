# Linked Lists

this is literally just a chain of elements linked together only by pointers to the next elemnet.
They are only better at insertions and deletions but everything else sucks.

## Definition

single node in a linked list containt pointer to the data that such pointer owns and a pointer to the next element in the list.
In order access any element in the list, it must be traversed in its entirety trought each element. Trought such problem can be mitigated.
Each element is allocated dynamically.
