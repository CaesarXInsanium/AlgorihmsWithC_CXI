# Stacks and Queues

Sometimes data needs to be accessed in a manner corresponding to which it is received.
Whether we want a first in first out, or first in last out approach.

For example a function stack is a method of organizing function calls in such a way
that when one function returns its value is passed to the stack memory of another and that function is left
to finish execution. Hard to explain in text.

## Stacks

Similar to real stack of cards. To get one at bottom, all cards above must be removed

## Queues

## Semaphores

## Event Handling

## X Window System
